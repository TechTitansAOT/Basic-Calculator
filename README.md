# Basic-Calculator

design a basic ui of calculator app.. 

Debpratim:- using JavaScript add a scrol bar effect that will only focus on the newer values that i input  and atuo hide the older values. Toggle the output class in the display section for the output result (basically it will change the color of the output) :)
